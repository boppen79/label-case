## Blindlock Exxact Sol M2 1.54
3D printed holder for Solum M2 1.54" tags so they can be mounted in the Exxact series from Schneider Electric (don't know in which countries they're available, but quite common in Sweden).
To be able to use it you need to use the mounting frame from the snap-in blind (https://www.se.com/se/sv/product/WDE002325/centrumplatta-exxact-blindlock-sn%C3%A4ppfasts%C3%A4ttning-inkl-pl%C3%A5tst%C3%B6dram-oh%C3%A5lad-vit/).

I have had some issues with the tab strenth when printing it laying flat up-side down (PETG). Best results so far: 100% infill, supports and no cooling.

## Solum M2 2.9
Files for CNC carving a holder for the Solum M2 2.9" tag. I recommend using 14mm thick wood.
