# Blindlock Exxact Sol M2 1.54
Holder for M2 1.54" tags so they can be mounted together with switches etc. in the Exxact series from Schneider (don't know in which countries it's available, but it's quite common in Sweden)
To be able to use it you need to use the mounting frame from the snap-in blind (https://www.se.com/se/sv/product/WDE002325/centrumplatta-exxact-blindlock-sn%C3%A4ppfasts%C3%A4ttning-inkl-pl%C3%A5tst%C3%B6dram-oh%C3%A5lad-vit/).

I have had some issues with the tab strenth when printing it laying down (PETG). Best results so far: 100% infill, supports and no cooling.
